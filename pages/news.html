                        to all Battle
                        Pass owners who reach level 255, the new Toy Butcher Persona for Pudge features an all-new
                        model, animations, and voice performance.

                        Feared amongst the fluff-stuffed denizens of the toy box, The Toy Butcher stalks the corners and
                        shadows of the bin, always on the hunt for his next kill. Every toy knows that once the butcher
                        gets his hook in you, your stuffing and your life are forfeit – like as not to be left strewn
                        about the lanes as the plushy monster jaunts happily away from your lonely, ragged remains.

                        Claim the new persona now in your Battle Pass and don’t forget to pick up the Voice of The
                        International Announcer Pack on your way, available to all Battle Pass Owners at level 75 and
                        above, to herald your next victory.

                        After being lost across multiple dimensions, Aghanim the Mighty, Aghanim the All-Knowing,
                        Aghanim
                        the
                        Absolutely-Yoked-and-Handsome, has found his way back to the realm — and he doesn’t arrive
                        alone.
                        Available to everyone and completely free-to-play, Aghanim’s Labyrinth is a four-player,
                        cooperative
                        roguelike that pits your party against Aghanim’s curated collection of interdimensional
                        monsters. No
                        Battle Pass required (although owners of the Battle Pass can earn points by playing).

                        Lost far beyond the astral plane for what felt to him like millennia, Aghanim tumbled hither and
                        yon
                        through the mists of creation, enriching his mind with magic from across the void. Aghanim
                        became
                        impossibly rich with unknowable insights — save for the simple knowledge of how to return. It
                        was
                        only before a chorus of faint voices broke through the din that he believed hope was lost.
                        There,
                        through darkness intertwined with ribbons of horror, could he hear hero after hero building HIS
                        scepter.
                        Gather your party and check out the Aghanim’s Labyrinth for a full overview of the mode. Hurry,
                        Aghanim awaits!</p>
